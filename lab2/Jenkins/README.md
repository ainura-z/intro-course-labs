# Jenkins

### Tool name and description

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool built for continuous integration (CI) and continious delivery (CD) of projects.

### Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context

In the DevOps context Jenkins provides the ability of CI/CD of the projects.
This leads to the following benefits:
1. Easier integration of changes to the project
2. Integration of a large number of testing and deployment technologies for continious delivery

### Key features and functionalities

1. **Automation**

Jenkins automates the process of building software projects from source code.

2. **CI/CD**

As it was mentioned above Jenkins allows to automate the integration of code changes as well as the deployment 
of applications to various environments, including development, testing, staging, and production.

3. **Extensibility**

Jenkins has a lot of plugins by using which it can be extended for new functionalities.

4. **Easy configuration**

Jenkins provides easy setting up and configuration through web interface.

5. **Distribution**

Distribution between machines can be easily achieved in Jenkins allowing faster building, testing, and deployment.

### Use cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios

1. **CI/CD automation**

Automation of integration and code quality checks providing the ability to find out the error before committing 
the buggy code into the master branch. Automation of the deployment process in the following pipeline
code -> build-> test-> deploy.

2. **Task automation**

For example, the installation and upgrading of multiple environments. Instead of doing this manually, which can lead to 
some mistakes and errors, it's better to write all the steps in Jenkins to perform the activity. Such automation will
spend less time on performing the task.
