# Task 1: Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

1. **Reading the Official Guide**

    1. I created a `.github/workflows` directory and then I created `github-actions-demo.yml` file inside thus directory.

        ![Alt text](images/image.png)

    2. After that I created a new branch for this commit and started a pull request. 

        ![Alt text](images/image-1.png)

    3. Committing the workflow file to a branch triggered the push event and ran the workflow.

    **Key concepts:**

        
    _Workflow_ : A predefined automated procedure, outlined in a YAML document, detailing the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) sequence for a given project.

    _Job_ : A collection of related steps carried out on a consistent runner, typically designated to complete a distinct task within the overarching workflow. 

    _Step_: A singular activity or procedure within a job. This could involve executing a script, running tests, or deploying software.

    _Runner_: This is the operational setting in which jobs are executed.

    _Event_: Certain actions or occurrences that initiate a workflow, which include activities like code pushes, initiating pull requests, and creating issues, among others.

    _Artifact_: These are files or a group of files produced during a workflow that can be retained and later utilized in following jobs. 

    _Workflow Dispatch_: A feature enabling the manual activation of a workflow through the GitHub API.

2. **Observing the Workflow Execution**

    I pushed some changes to my repository and the workflow started running automatically, because the push event triggers the "GitHub Actions Demo" workflow defined in github-actions-demo.yml.

    The logs of the executed workflow are the following:

    **Conclusion:** This workflow sets up an environment, checks out the code from a repository, and performs a few informational echo commands. I didn't dace with any errors.

    **Observations:** The workflow was triggered automatically when changes were pushed to the main branch, because we specified on: push setting in the workflow configuration. If there had been any errors in the workflow configuration or during its execution, a red X would appear in the "Actions" tab, signaling an unsuccessful run, while when everything is okay it's green. 


# Task 2 - Gathering system information and manual triggering

1. **Configure a Manual Trigger**

    To update workflow to be triggered manually, we need to change the following in `github-actions-demo.yml` file:

    ```
    - on: [push]
    + on: [workflow_dispatch]
    ```

    Now we can trigger the workflow manually by using button.

2. **Gather System Information**

    we need to include an additional step for gathering system information in our file  `github-actions-demo.yml`. The addition will be the following: 

    ```
    - run: |
      echo "Operating System Info:"
      uname -a

      echo "CPU Info:"
      lscpu

      echo "Memory Info:"
      free -h
    ```

    The results of the system information in the workflow output is the following:
