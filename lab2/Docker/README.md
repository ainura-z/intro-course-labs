# Docker

### Tool name and description

Docker is a containerization platform that allows to build, test, and deploy applications with all its dependencies together.

### Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context

The purpose of using Docker in the DevOps environment is its ability to containerize the applications. 
This leads to the following benefits:
1. Reduction of the time to develop and release a solution
2. Running the application on any environment
3. Streamline and control changes throughout the development cycle

### Key features and functionalities

1. **Containerization**

Package of the applications with all its dependencies inside the container giving the consistency in 
different environments.

2. **Isolation and security**

As containers are isolated from each other, it prevents from interactions between different applications.
This reduces the security risks.

3. **Scalability**

With the help of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos,
the containers can be deployed, managed, and scaled across clusters of machines.

4. **Efficiency in resources**

Containers are lightweight, because they share the host's kernel. 
This allows to run multiple containers on a single host without overhead.

### Use cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios

1. **Improvement in software testing**

Docker allows to automate testing, to isolate development tests from deployment tests,
to reduce the number of attempts required to rerun tests, and to keep the testing results consistent between environments.

2. **Creation of microservices architecture**

By using containerization Docker can isolate independent services in applications, allowing their 
individual managing and scaling.

3. **Porting across cloud providers**

Instead of running locally, Docker can be run on the cloud combining the advantages of containerization with 
the scalability, flexibility, and infrastructure management capabilities  of the cloud providers.
