### Definition of software distribution and its significance

Software distribution is the process of making a software available to the end user. This process involves several steps, including packaging, delivery, 
and installation. This tool allows to save time of developers as well as improve the security of a system by automated tracking on updates.

### Software distribution strategies and their characteristics

- **Physical media distribution:** As example of physical media can be CDs, DVDs, USB drives. In some regions it can be bad Internet connection,
for example, and the distribution with physical medai can be the only solution. However, it needs a lot of effort and money to deliver it to the end user
including manufacturing stage, then shipping. Moreover, with the fast developing such physical media will be outdated very quickly.

- **Online downloads from websites:** This strategy allows users to download software from the website directly. 
This is very common strategy nowadays, however it has risk for the users to download software from untrusted sources.

- **Platform-specific app stores:** This strategy includes platforms as Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Windows store, Microsoft Store.
It is a trusted source, which supports updates of software for users. Users can search, buy, and download software from these stores.
However, it can be challenging for developers to work with such applications because of strict store guidelines.

- **Cloud-based deployment:** This strategy allows to deploy software applications, services, or infrastructure resources on cloud computing 
platforms. Users don't need to think about resources, because cloud service provides infrastructure delivering computing power, 
storage, and services over the internet. The most popular cloud platforms are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform.

### Best practices for software distribution

- **documentation and support:** clear documentation is very crucial for every software as well as proper support in terms of telegram channels,
 mails or other ways for communication.
- **version control:** software should be updated on time for improving the features and fixing bugs.
- **feedback and analytics:** feedback is necessary for further improvement of the system along with analytics gathered on usage data.
- **automation and continuous delivery:** for acheiving continius delivery of the product and its updates, optimize the software deployment it is necessary to automate tools and processes.
- **security:** the software should be protected from hacking.
