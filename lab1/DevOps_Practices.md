DevOps is built by using a lot of principles, 
however for the goal of DevOps as a system providing 
the speeding up of processes from development to deployment, I think that
these principles can be considered as core principles:

1. **Collaboration and communication**

This principle stands for the idea of merging the development and operations teams
into a single team that works across the entire application lifecycle. Such 
communication will allow to work towards business objectives together leading to 
improvement of the product.

_Example_: As a real-world example of a good collaboration practitioners I can mention
Amazon Web Services (AMS). This company is known for a teams using a 
"Two-Pizza Team" model, where teams are small enough that they can be fed 
with two pizzas. This will lead to the better collaboration within the team and
as in turn will lead to the faster software delivering.

2. **Automation**

This principle stands for the idea of automation repetitive and manual tasks in the software development 
lifecycle, such as testing, CI/CD processes, network provisioning (IaC), monitoring.

_Example_: One of the example can be automation of building the resources from work tickets through Jira and Jenkins.

3. **Continious Integration and Delivery**

This principle stands for the idea of automated building and testing of code changes (CI) and 
automated deployment of code changes to production environments (CD).

_Example_: As examples of tools used for CI/CD can be Jenkins, GitLab. They help streamline 
the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.

4. **Continious Monitoring and Feedback**

This principle stands for the idea of real-time monitoring of the code in 
operation and the underlying infrastructure that supports it. It allows faster
collection and response to user feedback and bugs or issues reporting.

_Example_: Open source IT system monitoring tool Nagios is used for monitoring the performance issues of servers and easily finding the root cause of any problem.
