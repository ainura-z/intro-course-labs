### Steps to set up the project on Fleek.co

1. Sign up/in in the Fleek account
2. Then in the "Hosting" tab you need to press on "Add New Site"
3. Choose the project for hosting (I chose GitHub repository with static files)
4. Choose the "Hosting Services" (I chose 'IPFS')
5. In deploy setting choose the branch you want to deploy (I chose 'main') 
6. In "Basic Build Settings" set up settings if exists (I chose default setting "Other" in "Framework")
7. Press button "Deploy Site"

### Configuration settings

I don't have my own domain so I couldn't add custom domain.

### Links

1. [IPFS link](https://fleek.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcGd6GAASJaEHtuip4WwiWyaCoowkpVJx5jWfBSTV542g/)
2. [Default subdomain](https://dark-credit-3168.on.fleek.co/)

### Observations/Insights

I liked that for each setting Fleek provides documentation through links, because for me it was really convenient to read about something new and understand what you are doing.
