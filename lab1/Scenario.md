# Task 2

**Scenario**: A software development team is working on developing the online 
marketplace system for selling clothes but they are facing with the challenges
of slow release of new features in the mobile app, unplanned downtime and 
lack of scalability during the peaks of shopping.

1. **CI/CD**
   
This principle will help the team to create new features in the system
and fastly deliver it to the user. At the same time new features will be tested in advance
what will decrease the probability of future issues related to this feature.

2. **Automation**
   
The automation of infrastructure provisioning and scaling by using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 
IaC allows to scale the system up or down based on demand.
This ensures the ability of the platform to handle increased traffic during 
peak seasons.

3. **Continious Monitoring**
   
Real-time monitoring will help to identify the bugs and issues in the system 
which lead to downtimes. The automated incident response workflows will be established to
resolve incidents quickly.
